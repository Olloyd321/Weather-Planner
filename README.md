# Weather-Planner
This repo is for the week 6  weather app challenge.

## Purpose
The purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate my understanding of third party API's such as the 'Weather App API'

## Challenges 
The most challenging aspect of this project was the API call and then displaying that info. This project will not be my only submission as there is still more to do but this, with my current ability, is what I was able to put together from scratch, I intend on further refining the site as my understanding of coding grows. 

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
