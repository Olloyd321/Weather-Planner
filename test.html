This code includes a form where users can enter the name of a city, and a few empty <span> tags with IDs where we can later use JavaScript to fill in the city name, temperature, and weather information. Of course, this is just a starting point, and you will need to add JavaScript and CSS to make the app functional and visually appealing.

Explain how expressions in math work
In mathematics, an expression is a combination of numbers, variables, and mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Expressions can be used to represent a wide range of mathematical problems, from simple arithmetic to complex algebraic equations.

Here are a few examples of expressions in math:

2 + 3 - 1: This expression contains three numbers and two addition/subtraction operators.

4 × (5 - 2): This expression contains two numbers, two operators, and a set of parentheses to indicate that the subtraction operation should be done before the multiplication operation.

x² + 3x - 4: This expression contains two variables (x and x²), two numbers, and two operators. This is an example of a polynomial expression.

When evaluating an expression, we typically follow a set of rules to perform the mathematical operations in the correct order. This is known as the order of operations, which typically follows the acronym PEMDAS: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (performed from left to right), and addition and subtraction (performed from left
